# Portfolio-Website

This is website about me made in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The site is available at [this link](https://karloleksic.github.io/Portfolio-Website/)

## ⚠️ Notice ⚠️

This is my first independently created website, and it is not the best representation of my current skills❗ 

It was created before the start of my professional career as a frontend developer❗

The information is outdated, the site is no longer maintained, and it only exists to show how long I have been exploring and learning web development❗
